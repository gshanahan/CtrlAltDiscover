                    <p>
                        As the use of A.I., or Artificial Intelligence, grows rapidly in todayâ€™s society, many start to wonder what industries are most impacted by the emergence of this new technology. Many are afraid that this new tech will replace some positions entirely. While this is a possibility on the horizon as technology improves and we get closer to A.G.I. (Artificial General Intelligence), it is more useful to think of ways this tech can be used as more of a supplement. Instead of outright replacing jobs, why not use this technology as a tool to improve workflows and efficiency in an already established position? Many companies are beginning to ask this question, and we are starting to see the beginnings of widespread use of Machine Learning algorithms in the Cybersecurity space as exactly that: a tool, not a replacement. 
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        First let's start with some definitions. A.I., or Artificial Intelligence, also referred to as Machine Learning, is the process of using algorithms and software to mimic the thought processes of a human. This can be seen by the popular ChatGPT which uses LLMs, or Large Language Models, as a way to mimic the speech patterns and recognition of a human. It achieves this by digesting huge amounts of data containing human written text, and infers relationships between the words, punctuation, sentences, and writing styles of the text.
	                    <br><br>
                        As expected, these types of Machine Learning algorithms can prove extremely useful in the cybersecurity realm. What else requires the use of pattern recognition/association and can be trained with huge amounts of historical data? That's right, anomaly detection. This use of A.I. is perfect because these algorithms are essentially made for use in threat detection and incident response, whether or not the designers intended for it.
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        Many experts believe A.I. powered threat detection is the future of the security space. These systems are capable of processing massive amounts of information from multiple sources. These sources can include anything from network traffic logs to dark web forums, and much more. Also, because of the way these algorithms work, they can find patterns and anomalies much faster than any human could. Workers in this space need not worry, however. As powerful as these algorithms can be, at the end of the day a human analyst has to be the one to handle the reports and alerts that are generated. This automated work just allows the analysts to dedicate more time to things such as planning and threat mitigation strategies; things that A.I. is still a long way from being able to handle itself.
	                    <br><br>
                        As stated previously, these algorithms excel in pattern recognition. When trained with a huge pool of data containing normal baseline user behavior, it can be used to monitor real-time user behavior and compare it to the baselines. The great thing about A.I. is it improves with time, so the longer a system is used to monitor user behavior and the more data is fed into the system the more accurate its alerts become. These systems largely use NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to analyze this data. These techniques include natural language understanding, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. This allows the systems to analyze things like social media and news articles to predict possible threat vectors and respond accordingly. 
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        In addition to threat detection, A.I. can prove very useful in the area of incident response. As discussed previously, some systems can be configured to analyze feeds and articles to predict future threats and help mitigate them. A.I. can also facilitate the rapid sharing of threat information between companies and organizations, allowing everyone involved to respond/prevent threats faster than ever before. Since A.I. can be used to monitor real-time user behavior and detect anomalies, these systems can be configured to immediately put in  place some stop gaps/mitigation techniques and give a human incident response analyst some time to respond themselves.
                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        Currently, the future looks very bright for workers in the Artificial Intelligence space. Especially for A.I. enabled cybersecurity systems. With time these systems will only get better, faster, more accurate, and more powerful. Not to mention as more and more organizations shift from traditional infrastructure to a more cloud-based structure, these automated systems will only become more commonplace. Many DevOps teams are integrating these A.I. detection systems into their workflow, increasing productivity and effectiveness. One major challenge that organizations face is knowing exactly how to implement these systems into their security infrastructure. Choosing the right algorithms is crucial, and training it with accurate and sizable datasets is equally as important. Public Libraries such as 'OpenAI', 'SageMaker', 'HuggingFace', etc. can all prove useful to integrate into your IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but each one specializes in different areas due to the difference in algorithms used. For many business owners this is very difficult to understand, and just emphasizes the importance of having well trained and experienced cybersecurity experts on your team.
